# Student Management Database Server
This is the backend server used to host an SQLite database which stores the details for students, accounts and modules in different tables chosen for a student management system website. The code here allows the user to perform CRUD operations on these details and there are HTTP pages which allow the user to test these operations for each table.

The code for the frontend website can be found here: https://github.com/frhn13/StudentManagementSystem
